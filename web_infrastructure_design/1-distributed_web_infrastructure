## Explanation : 

- Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes incoming traffic to multiple servers. Prevents overload.

- Algorithm: Commonly Round Robin → cycles requests between servers.

- Active-Active: Both servers work simultaneously to handle traffic.

- Active-Passive: One server works, the other is on standby.

- Database Master-Replica setup:

- Primary (Master): Handles all writes.

- Replica (Slave): Copies data from Master, used for read operations.

## Issues : 

- SPOF: The load balancer itself can fail.

- Security: No HTTPS or firewalls → vulnerable to attacks.

- Monitoring: No system to detect failures.
