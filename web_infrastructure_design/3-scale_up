3. Scale Up 

Now we scale up by separating responsibilities and improving redundancy.

- The user types www.foobar.com
, DNS points to the IP of a load balancer cluster.

- Instead of one, there are now two load balancers working in a cluster. If one fails, the other automatically takes over, avoiding SPOF at the load balancing level.

- The load balancers send traffic to a pool of web servers:
    These servers only run Nginx and handle static content (HTML, CSS, images).
    Dynamic requests are forwarded to a separate set of application servers.

- The application servers only run the business logic and process requests from the web servers.

- The databases are also separated:
    One MySQL Master accepts all write operations.
    One or several MySQL Replicas (Slaves) replicate the Master and handle read requests.

## Advantages:

- Separation of concerns: Each server has a single role (web, application, or database).

- Independent scalability: If more traffic arrives, we can add more web servers; if the application logic is heavy, we can add more app servers; if there are many read queries, we can add more replicas.

- Resilience: With two load balancers in a cluster, there is no SPOF at the load balancing level.
