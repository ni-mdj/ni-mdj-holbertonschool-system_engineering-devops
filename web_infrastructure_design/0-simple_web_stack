## Explanation : 

- Server: A physical or virtual machine that hosts the website.

- Domain name (foobar.com): Human-readable name that maps to the server’s IP.

- DNS record: The www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME or A record. In this case, it points to IP 8.8.8.8.

- Web server (Nginx): Handles HTTP requests, serves static files, forwards requests to the application server.

- Application server: Executes the application logic (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby).

- Application files: The website’s code base.

- Database (MySQL): Stores and manages data.

- Communication with user: Done via the HTTP protocol (port 80).

## Issues : 

- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server crashes, the site is down.

- Maintenance downtime: Restarting server or updating code makes the site unavailable.

- Scalability issues: Can’t handle high traffic since only one server exists.
